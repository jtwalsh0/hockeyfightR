Description: Using data from hockeyfights.com, this R package does two things:
    1) it estimates the quality of each fighter and 2) it predicts who would win a
    fight. It uses information about each fighter, such as who the fighter is, how
    old he is when the fight takes place, and whether he was the home fighter.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.1)
